The easiest way to link the library is using the CLI tool by running this command from the root of your project:\n\n```\n$ react-native link @react-native-community/masked-view\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nImport the `MaskedView` component from `@react-native-community/masked-view` and use it like so:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Text, View } from 'react-native';\nimport MaskedView from '@react-native-community/masked-view';\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <MaskedView\n        style={{ flex: 1, flexDirection: 'row', height: '100%' }}\n        maskElement={\n          <View\n            style={{\n              // Transparent background because mask is based off alpha channel.\n              backgroundColor: 'transparent',\n              flex: 1,\n              justifyContent: 'center',\n              alignItems: 'center'\n            }}\n          >\n            <Text\n              style={{\n                fontSize: 60,\n                color: 'black',\n                fontWeight: 'bold'\n              }}\n            >\n              Basic Mask\n            </Text>\n          </View>\n        }\n      >\n        {/* Shows behind the mask, you can put anything here, such as an image */}\n        <View style={{ flex: 1, height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#324376' }} />\n        <View style={{ flex: 1, height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#F5DD90' }} />\n        <View style={{ flex: 1, height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#F76C5E' }} />\n        <View style={{ flex: 1, height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#e1e1e1' }} />\n      </MaskedView>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe following image demonstrates that you can put almost anything behind the mask. The three examples shown are masked `<View>`, `<Text>`, and `<Image>`.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/example.png\" width=\"200\"></img></p>\n\n### Props\n\n- [View props...](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/blob/master/docs/view.md#props)\n\n* [`maskElement`](#maskelement)\n\n# Reference\n\n## Props\n\n### `maskElement`\n\n| Type    | Required |\n| ------- | -------- |\n| element | Yes      |\n\n<!-- badges -->\n\n[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/react-native-community/react-native-masked-view/master.svg?style=flat-square\n[build]: https://circleci.com/gh/react-native-community/react-native-masked-view\n[version-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@react-native-community/masked-view.svg?style=flat-square\n[package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/masked-view\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@react-native-community/masked-view.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[lean-core-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Lean%20Core-Extracted-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[lean-core-issue]: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313",

	"agent-base": "agent-base\n==========\n### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)\n\nThis module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install agent-base\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net');\nvar tls = require('tls');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar agent = require('agent-base');\n\nvar endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// This is the important part!\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\n  var socket;\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\n  } else {\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\n  }\n  return socket;\n});\n\n// Everything else works just like normal...\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\n\n```js\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // etc…\n});\n```\n\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \"pass through\" the responsibility\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\n\n```js\nagent(function (req, opts) {\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]\n\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\n\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\n\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\n\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\n\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined\n\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\ncontinue to proceed.\n\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent",

It will either trim the results or add necessary amount of spaces. The `bias` control if trimming/padding should be done at the start of the string representing built children or at the end.\n\n```js\nfixed(5, 'start', 'ERR'); // => '  ERR'\nfixed(8, 'end', color('green', 'success')); // equals to color('green', 'success') + ' '\nfixed(10, 'end', 'Hello', pad(2), 'World') // => 'Hello  Wor'\n```\n\n#### `ifElse`\n\n```ts\nifElse(\n  condition: Condition,\n  ifTrueFragment: string | IFragment,\n  elseFragment: string | IFragment\n): IFragment\n\ntype ConditionValue = boolean | string | number | null | undefined;\ntype Condition = ConditionValue | (() => ConditionValue);\n```\n\nChange the output based on condition. Condition can ba a primitive value, which can be casted to boolean or a function. If conation or return value of condition is evaluated to `true`, the first argument - `ifTrueFragment` will be used, otherwise `elseFragment`.\n\n```js\nlet condition = getConditionValue()\nifElse(\n  () => condition,\n  color('red', 'ERROR'),\n  color('yellow', 'WARNING')\n)\n```\n\n#### `provide`\n\n```ts\nprovide<T>(\n  value: T,\n  builder: (value: T) => string | IFragment\n): IFragment\n```\n\nProvides given value to a builder function, which should return `string` or fragment. Useful in situations when the output is connected with some calculated value - using `provide` you only need to calculate final value once and forward it to custom styling logic.\n\n```js\nprovide(getMessageFromSomewhere(), value => {\n  switch (value.level) {\n    case 'error':\n      return container(\n        color('red', modifier('bold', value.level.toUpperCase())),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    case 'info':\n      return container(\n        color('blue', value.level.toUpperCase()),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    default:\n      return container(value.level.toUpperCase(), pad(2), value.log);\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n<!-- badges (common) -->\n\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[prs-welcome-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[prs-welcome]: http://makeapullrequest.com\n[coc-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20of-conduct-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square\n[coc]: https://github.com/zamotany/ansi-fragments/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-discord-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square&colorB=7289DA&logo=discord\n[chat]: https://discord.gg/zwR2Cdh\n\n[version]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-fragments",

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

	"babel-plugin-syntax-trailing-function-commas": "# babel-plugin-syntax-trailing-function-commas\n\n> Compile trailing function commas to ES5\n\n\n```js\nfunction clownPuppiesEverywhere(\n  param1,\n  param2,\n) { /* ... */ }\n\nclownPuppiesEverywhere(\n  'foo',\n  'bar',\n);\n```\n\n## Example\n\n### Basic\nThis is an example from the [Proposal](https://github.com/jeffmo/es-trailing-function-commas).\n\nLet's say you have this function:\n\n```js\nfunction clownPuppiesEverywhere(\n  param1,\n  param2\n) { /* ... */ }\n\nclownPuppiesEverywhere(\n  'foo',\n  'bar'\n);\n```\n\nIf you want to have a new parameter called `param3`, the diff output would be like that:\n\n```diff\nfunction clownPuppiesEverywhere(\n  param1,\n- param2\n+ param2, // Change this line to add a comma\n+ param3  // Add param3\n) { /* ... */ }\n\nclownPuppiesEverywhere(\n  'foo',\n- 'bar'\n+ 'bar', // Change this line to add a comma\n+ 'baz'  // Add param3\n);\n```\nIn total, you have to change 2 lines for the function declaration and 2 lines for each usage.\n\nIf you had your function defined with trailing commas:\n\n```js\nfunction clownPuppiesEverywhere(\n  param1,\n  param2,\n) { /* ... */ }\n\nclownPuppiesEverywhere(\n  'foo',\n  'bar',\n);\n```\nAdding a new parameter would only change one line in the function declaration and one line for each usage:\n\n```diff\nfunction clownPuppiesEverywhere(\n  param1,\n  param2,\n+ param3, // Add param3\n) { /* ... */ }\n\nclownPuppiesEverywhere(\n  'foo',\n  'bar',\n+ 'baz', // Add param3\n);\n```\nIn the end, your diff output will be cleaner and easier to read, it would be much quicker to add a new parameter to your functions, it also makes it easier to copy paste elements and move code around.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev babel-plugin-syntax-trailing-function-commas\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)\n\n**.babelrc**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"syntax-trailing-function-commas\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Via CLI\n\n```sh\nbabel --plugins syntax-trailing-function-commas script.js\n```\n\n### Via Node API\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\"babel-core\").transform(\"code\", {\n  plugins: [\"syntax-trailing-function-commas\"]\n});\n```\n\n## References\n\n* [Proposal](https://github.com/jeffmo/es-trailing-function-commas)\n* [Spec](http://jeffmo.github.io/es-trailing-function-commas/)\n* [Why you should enforce Dangling Commas for Multiline Statements](https://medium.com/@nikgraf/why-you-should-enforce-dangling-commas-for-multiline-statements-d034c98e36f8)",

	"boolbase": "#boolbase\nThis very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).\n\n###WTF?\n\nBy having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.",

Throws an error if the\ninput is invalid.\n\n```js\nvar obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);\n```\n\n### bser.dumpToBuffer\n\nSynchronously encodes a value as BSER.\n\n```js\nvar encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);\nconsole.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']\n```\n\n### BunserBuf\n\nThe asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.\nYou may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the\ndecoded values via its `value` event.\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log(obj);\n});\n```\n\nThen in your socket `data` event:\n\n```js\nbunser.append(buf);\n```\n\n## Example\n\nRead BSER from socket:\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log('data from socket', obj);\n});\n\nvar socket = net.connect('/socket');\n\nsocket.on('data', function(buf) {\n  bunser.append(buf);\n});\n```\n\nWrite BSER to socket:\n\n```js\nsocket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));\n```",

	"denodeify": "denodeify [ ![Codeship Status for matthew-andrews/denodeify](https://codeship.io/projects/02ac77d0-1a58-0132-bf86-4a07366ee29d/status)](https://codeship.io/projects/34622)\n=========\n\nTool to turn functions with Node-style callback APIs into functions that return [Promises](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise).\n\nInspired by and adapted from Q's [`Q.denodeify`/`Q.nfcall` function](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#qnfbindnodefunc-args).\n\nWarning: This micro-library doesn't force you to use any particular Promise implementation by using whatever `Promise` has been defined as globally.  This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.\n\nIf you're running the code on a browser or node version that doesn't include native promises you will need to include a polyfill.  The following polyfills are tested as part of this module's test suite:-\n- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s [ES6 Promise library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) (which is actually adapted from [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)'s [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)). -  `require('es6-promise').polyfill();`\n- [Getify](https://twitter.com/getify)'s [Native Promise Only library](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - `require('native-promise-only');`\n- [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) - `require('es6-shim');`\n- [Calvin Metcalf](https://twitter.com/CWMma)'s [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - `global.Promise = global.Promise || require('lie');`\n\nNote: as of v1.2.0 you can use **denodeify** in the front end.  Pull it in via CommonJS, AMD or simply add to your webpage and it'll be available on `window.denodeify`. \n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install denodeify --save\n```\n\nOr:-\n\n```\nbower install denodeify --save\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nSimple example with [`readFile`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/read-file):-\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar readFile = denodeify(require('fs').readFile);\n\nreadFile('my-file.txt', { encoding: 'UTF-8' })\n  .then(function(text) {\n    console.log(\"My file's contents is: \" + text);\n  });\n```\n\n(Note: you will need to also install [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) with `npm install es6-promise` for this code sample to work within node versions that don't have `Promise` natively available)\n\nMore complex example with `exec`:-\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nYou can also pass in a function as a second argument of `denodeify` that allows you to manipulate the data returned by the wrapped function before it gets passed to the Promise's `reject` or `resolve` functions, for example:-\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n\n  // Throw away stderr data\n  return [err, stdout];\n});\n\nexec('hostname')\n  .then(function(host) {\n    console.log(\"My hostname is: \" + host.replace('\\n', ''));\n  });\n```\n\nOr,\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  return [err, [stdout, stderr]];\n});\n\nexec('my-command')\n  .then(function(results) {\n    console.log(\"stdout is: \" + results[0]);\n    console.log(\"stderr is: \" + results[1]);\n  });\n```\n\nUseful for functions that return multiple arguments, for example [`child_process#exec`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).\n\n## Credits and collaboration ##\n\nThe lead developer of **denodeify** is [Matt Andrews](http://twitter.com/andrewsmatt) at FT Labs with much help and support from [Kornel Lesiński](https://twitter.com/pornelski). All open source code released by FT Labs is licenced under the MIT licence. We welcome comments, feedback and suggestions.  Please feel free to raise an issue or pull request.",

Trademarks.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

	"firebase": "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/firebase-js-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/firebase-js-sdk)\n\n# Firebase - App success made simple\n\n## Overview\n\n[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) provides the tools and infrastructure\nyou need to develop, grow, and earn money from your app. This package supports\nweb (browser), mobile-web, and server (Node.js) clients.\n\nFor more information, visit:\n\n- [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start) -\n  The Firebase Realtime Database lets you store and query user data, and makes\n  it available between users in realtime.\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) -\n  Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server\n  development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.\n- [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/start) -\n  Firebase Storage lets you upload and store user generated content, such as\n  files, and images.\n- [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/client) -\n  Firebase Cloud Messaging is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you\n  reliably deliver messages at no cost.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/manage-users) -\n  Firebase helps you authenticate and manage users who access your application.\n- [Create and setup your account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) -\n  Get started using Firebase for free.\n\nThis SDK is intended for end-user client access from environments such as the\nWeb, mobile Web (e.g. React Native, Ionic), Node.js desktop (e.g. Electron), or\nIoT devices running Node.js. If you are instead interested in using a Node.js\nSDK which grants you admin access from a privileged environment (like a server),\nyou should use the\n[Firebase Admin Node.js SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup/).\n\n## Get the code (browser)\n\n### Script include\n>This brings in all Firebase features. See\n>[\"Include only the features you need\"](#include-only-the-features-you-need)\n>below for\n>how to minimize download size by only including the scripts you need.\n\nInclude Firebase in your web application via a `<script>` tag:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${JSCORE_VERSION}/firebase.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n  var app = firebase.initializeApp({\n    apiKey: '<your-api-key>',\n    authDomain: '<your-auth-domain>',\n    databaseURL: '<your-database-url>',\n    projectId: '<your-cloud-firestore-project>',\n    storageBucket: '<your-storage-bucket>',\n    messagingSenderId: '<your-sender-id>'\n  });\n  // ...\n</script>\n```\n\n_Note: To get a filled in version of the above code snippet, go to the\n[Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) for your app and click on \"Add\nFirebase to your web app\"._\n\n### npm bundler (Browserify, Webpack, etc.)\n\n>This brings in all Firebase features. See\n>[\"Include only the features you need\"](#include-only-the-features-you-need)\n>below for\n>how to minimize bundle size by only importing the features you need.\n\nThe Firebase JavaScript npm package contains code that can be run in the browser\nafter combining the modules you use with a package bundler (e.g.,\n[Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)).\n\nInstall the Firebase npm module:\n\n```\n$ npm init\n$ npm install --save firebase\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access Firebase using:\n\n```js\nvar firebase = require('firebase');\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n```\n\nIf you are using ES6 imports or TypeScript:\n\n```js\nimport firebase from 'firebase';\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n```\n\n### Include only the features you need\n\nThe full Firebase JavaScript client includes support for Firebase Authentication, the\nFirebase Realtime Database, Firebase Storage, and Firebase Cloud Messaging. Including\ncode via the above snippets will pull in all of these features.\n\nYou can reduce the amount of code your app uses by just including the features\nyou need. The individually installable services are:\n\n- `firebase-app` - The core `firebase` client (required).\n- `firebase-auth` - Firebase Authentication (optional).\n- `firebase-database` - The Firebase Realtime Database (optional).\n- `firebase-firestore` - Cloud Firestore (optional).\n- `firebase-storage` - Firebase Storage (optional).\n- `firebase-messaging` - Firebase Cloud Messaging (optional).\n- `firebase-functions` - Firebase Cloud Functions (optional).\n\nFrom the CDN, include the individual services you use (include `firebase-app`\nfirst):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-app.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-auth.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-database.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-firestore.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-storage.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-messaging.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-functions.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n  var app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n  // ...\n</script>\n```\n\nWhen using the firebase npm package, you can `require()` just the services that\nyou use:\n\n```js\nvar firebase = require('firebase/app');\nrequire('firebase/auth');\nrequire('firebase/database');\n\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n```\n\nIf you are using TypeScript with the npm package, you can import just the\nservices you use:\n\n```js\n// This import loads the firebase namespace along with all its type information.\nimport firebase from 'firebase/app';\n\n// These imports load individual services into the firebase namespace.\nimport 'firebase/auth';\nimport 'firebase/database';\n```\n\n_The type information from the import statement will include all of the SDKs,\nnot just the ones you have `required`, so you could get a runtime error if you\nreference a non-required service._\n\n## Get the code (Node.js - server and command line)\n\n### NPM\n\nWhile you can write entire Firebase applications without any backend code, many\ndevelopers want to write server applications or command-line utilities using the\nNode.js JavaScript runtime.\n\nYou can use the same npm module to use Firebase in the Node.js runtime (on a\nserver or running from the command line):\n\n```\n$ npm init\n$ npm install --save firebase\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access Firebase using:\n\n```js\nvar firebase = require('firebase');\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n// ...\n```\n\nIf you are using native ES6 module with --experimental-modules flag (or Node 12+)\nyou should do:\n\n```js\n// This import loads the firebase namespace.\nimport firebase from 'firebase/app';\n\n// These imports load individual services into the firebase namespace.\nimport 'firebase/auth';\nimport 'firebase/database';\n```\n\n_Known issue for typescript users with --experimental-modules: you have to set allowSyntheticDefaultImports to true in tsconfig.json to pass the type check. Use it with caution since it makes the assumption that all modules have a default export, which might not be the case for the other dependencies you have. And Your code will break if you try to import the default export from a module that doesn't have default export._\n\nFirebase Storage is not included in the server side Firebase npm module.\nInstead, you can use the\n[`google-cloud` Node.js client](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node).\n\n```\n$ npm install --save google-cloud\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access your Storage bucket using:\n\n```js\nvar gcloud = require('google-cloud')({ ... });\nvar gcs = gcloud.storage();\nvar bucket = gcs.bucket('<your-firebase-storage-bucket>');\n...\n```\n\nFirebase Cloud Messaging is not included in the server side Firebase npm module.\nInstead, you can use the\n[Firebase Cloud Messaging Rest API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/send-message).\n\n## API definition\n\nIf you use the\n[Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) or\ncompatible IDE, you can find API definitions for all the Firebase JavaScript API\nin the included `/externs` directory in this package:\n\n```\nexterns/\n  firebase-app-externs.js\n  firebase-auth-externs.js\n  firebase-database-externs.js\n  firebase-firestore-externs.js\n  firebase-storage-externs.js\n  firebase-messaging-externs.js\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\nThe Firebase changelog can be found at\n[firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/js).\n\n## Browser/environment compatibility\n\nPlease see [Environment Support](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/environments_js-sdk).",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

	"https-proxy-agent": "https-proxy-agent\n================\n### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)\n\nThis module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified\nHTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.\n\nSpecifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary \"proxy\"\nserver and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to\nopen a direct TCP connection to the destination server.\n\nSince this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other\nprotocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).\nSee the \"Examples\" section below for more.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install https-proxy-agent\n```\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n#### `https` module example\n\n``` js\nvar url = require('url');\nvar https = require('https');\nvar HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');\n\n// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';\nconsole.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);\nvar options = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\nvar agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);\noptions.agent = agent;\n\nhttps.get(options, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\n#### `ws` WebSocket connection example\n\n``` js\nvar url = require('url');\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');\n\n// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\nconsole.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\nvar options = url.parse(proxy);\n\nvar agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);\n\n// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection\nvar socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });\n\nsocket.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('\"open\" event!');\n  socket.send('hello world');\n});\n\nsocket.on('message', function (data, flags) {\n  console.log('\"message\" event! %j %j', data, flags);\n  socket.close();\n});\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)\n\nThe `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects\nto the specified \"HTTP(s) proxy server\" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket\nrequests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

	"imurmurhash": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

[Plugins](#plugins)\n\n\n## Goal and Philosophy\n\n<img align=\"right\" alt=\"Inquirer Logo\" src=\"/assets/inquirer_readme.png\" title=\"Inquirer.js\"/>\n\n**`Inquirer.js`** strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and perhaps the \"CLI [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane)\").\n\n**`Inquirer.js`** should ease the process of\n- providing *error feedback*\n- *asking questions*\n- *parsing* input\n- *validating* answers\n- managing *hierarchical prompts*\n\n> **Note:** **`Inquirer.js`** provides the user interface and the inquiry session flow. If you're searching for a full blown command line program utility, then check out [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js), [vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal) or [args](https://github.com/leo/args).\n\n\n## [Documentation](#documentation)\n<a name=\"documentation\"></a>\n\n### Installation\n<a name=\"installation\"></a>\n\n``` shell\nnpm install inquirer\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar inquirer = require('inquirer');\ninquirer.prompt([/* Pass your questions in here */]).then(function (answers) {\n\t// Use user feedback for... whatever!!\n});\n```\n\n<a name=\"examples\"></a>\n### Examples (Run it and see it)\nCheck out the `examples/` folder for code and interface examples.\n\n``` shell\nnode examples/pizza.js\nnode examples/checkbox.js\n# etc...\n```\n\n\n### Methods\n<a name=\"methods\"></a>\n#### `inquirer.prompt(questions) -> promise`\n\nLaunch the prompt interface (inquiry session)\n\n- **questions** (Array) containing [Question Object](#question) (using the [reactive interface](#reactive-interface), you can also pass a `Rx.Observable` instance)\n- returns a **Promise**\n\n#### `inquirer.registerPrompt(name, prompt)`\n\nRegister prompt plugins under `name`.\n\n- **name** (string) name of the this new prompt. (used for question `type`)\n- **prompt** (object) the prompt object itself (the plugin)\n\n#### `inquirer.createPromptModule() -> prompt function`\n\nCreate a self contained inquirer module. If you don't want to affect other libraries that also rely on inquirer when you overwrite or add new prompt types.\n\n```js\nvar prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();\n\nprompt(questions).then(/* ... */);\n```\n\n### Objects\n<a name=\"objects\"></a>\n\n#### Question\n<a name=\"questions\"></a>\nA question object is a `hash` containing question related values:\n\n- **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `confirm`,\n`list`, `rawlist`, `expand`, `checkbox`, `password`, `editor`\n- **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash. If the name contains periods, it will define a path in the answers hash.\n- **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.\n- **default**: (String|Number|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.\n- **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.\nArray values can be simple `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator).\n- **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and answers hash. Should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided.\n- **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash.\n- **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean.\n- **pageSize**: (Number) Change the number of lines that will be rendered when using `list`, `rawList`, `expand` or `checkbox`.\n- **prefix**: (String) Change the default _prefix_ message.\n- **suffix**: (String) Change the default _suffix_ message.\n\n`default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronous. Either return a promise or use `this.async()` to get a callback you'll call with the final value.\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  /* Preferred way: with promise */\n  filter: function () {\n    return new Promise(/* etc... */);\n  },\n\n  /* Legacy way: with this.async */\n  validate: function (input) {\n    // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback\n    var done = this.async();\n\n    // Do async stuff\n    setTimeout(function () {\n      if (typeof input !== 'number') {\n        // Pass the return value in the done callback\n        done('You need to provide a number');\n        return;\n      }\n      // Pass the return value in the done callback\n      done(null, true);\n    }, 3000);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Answers\n<a name=\"answers\"></a>\nA key/value hash containing the client answers in each prompt.\n\n- **Key** The `name` property of the _question_ object\n- **Value** (Depends on the prompt)\n  - `confirm`: (Boolean)\n  - `input` : User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (String)\n  - `rawlist`, `list` : Selected choice value (or name if no value specified) (String)\n\n### Separator\n<a name=\"separator\"></a>\nA separator can be added to any `choices` array:\n\n```\n// In the question object\nchoices: [ \"Choice A\", new inquirer.Separator(), \"choice B\" ]\n\n// Which'll be displayed this way\n[?] What do you want to do?\n > Order a pizza\n   Make a reservation\n   --------\n   Ask opening hours\n   Talk to the receptionist\n```\n\nThe constructor takes a facultative `String` value that'll be use as the separator. If omitted, the separator will be `--------`.\n\nSeparator instances have a property `type` equal to `separator`. This should allow tools façading Inquirer interface from detecting separator types in lists.\n\n<a name=\"prompt\"></a>\n### Prompt types\n---------------------\n\n> **Note:**: _allowed options written inside square brackets (`[]`) are optional. Others are required._\n\n#### List - `{type: 'list'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that\ndefault must be the choice `index` in the array or a choice `value`)\n\n![List prompt](assets/screenshots/list-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Raw List - `{type: 'rawlist'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that\ndefault must the choice `index` in the array)\n\n![Raw list prompt](assets/screenshots/rawlist-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Expand - `{type: 'expand'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`] properties. (Note that\ndefault must be the choice `index` in the array. If `default` key not provided, then `help` will be used as default choice)\n\nNote that the `choices` object will take an extra parameter called `key` for the `expand` prompt. This parameter must be a single (lowercased) character. The `h` option is added by the prompt and shouldn't be defined by the user.\n\nSee `examples/expand.js` for a running example.\n\n![Expand prompt closed](assets/screenshots/expand-prompt-1.png)\n![Expand prompt expanded](assets/screenshots/expand-prompt-2.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Checkbox - `{type: 'checkbox'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `filter`, `validate`, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be an Array of the checked choices value.\n\nChoices marked as `{checked: true}` will be checked by default.\n\nChoices whose property `disabled` is truthy will be unselectable. If `disabled` is a string, then the string will be outputted next to the disabled choice, otherwise it'll default to `\"Disabled\"`. The `disabled` property can also be a synchronous function receiving the current answers as argument and returning a boolean or a string.\n\n![Checkbox prompt](assets/screenshots/checkbox-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Confirm - `{type: 'confirm'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be a boolean if used.\n\n![Confirm prompt](assets/screenshots/confirm-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Input - `{type: 'input'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.\n\n![Input prompt](assets/screenshots/input-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Password - `{type: 'password'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.\n\n![Password prompt](assets/screenshots/password-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Editor - `{type: 'editor'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties\n\nLaunches an instance of the users preferred editor on a temporary file. Once the user exits their editor, the contents of the temporary file are read in as the result. The editor to use is determined by reading the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables. If neither of those are present, notepad (on Windows) or vim (Linux or Mac) is used.\n\n<a name=\"layouts\"></a>\n## User Interfaces and layouts\n\n\nAlong with the prompts, Inquirer offers some basic text UI.\n\n#### Bottom Bar - `inquirer.ui.BottomBar`\n\nThis UI present a fixed text at the bottom of a free text zone. This is useful to keep a message to the bottom of the screen while outputting command outputs on the higher section.\n\n```javascript\nvar ui = new inquirer.ui.BottomBar();\n\n// pipe a Stream to the log zone\noutputStream.pipe(ui.log);\n\n// Or simply write output\nui.log.write('something just happened.');\nui.log.write('Almost over, standby!');\n\n// During processing, update the bottom bar content to display a loader\n// or output a progress bar, etc\nui.updateBottomBar('new bottom bar content');\n```\n\n<a name=\"reactive\"></a>\n## Reactive interface\n\n\nInternally, Inquirer uses the [JS reactive extension](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) to handle events and async flows.\n\nThis mean you can take advantage of this feature to provide more advanced flows. For example, you can dynamically add questions to be asked:\n\n```js\nvar prompts = new Rx.Subject();\ninquirer.prompt(prompts);\n\n// At some point in the future, push new questions\nprompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });\nprompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });\n\n// When you're done\nprompts.onCompleted();\n```\n\nAnd using the return value `process` property, you can access more fine grained callbacks:\n\n```js\ninquirer.prompt(prompts).ui.process.subscribe(\n  onEachAnswer,\n  onError,\n  onComplete\n);\n```\n\n## Support (OS Terminals)\n<a name=\"support\"></a>\n\nYou should expect mostly good support for the CLI below. This does not mean we won't\nlook at issues found on other command line - feel free to report any!\n\n- **Mac OS**:\n  - Terminal.app\n  - iTerm\n- **Windows**:\n  - [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)\n  - cmd.exe\n  - Powershell\n  - Cygwin\n- **Linux (Ubuntu, openSUSE, Arch Linux, etc)**:\n  - gnome-terminal (Terminal GNOME)\n  - konsole\n\n\n## News on the march (Release notes)\n<a name=\"news\"></a>\n\n\nPlease refer to the [Github releases section for the changelog](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/releases)\n\n\n## Contributing\n<a name=\"contributing\"></a>\n\n**Unit test**\nUnit test are written in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). Please add a unit test for every new feature or bug fix. `npm test` to run the test suite.\n\n**Documentation**\nAdd documentation for every API change. Feel free to send typo fixes and better docs!\n\nWe're looking to offer good support for multiple prompts and environments. If you want to\nhelp, we'd like to keep a list of testers for each terminal/OS so we can contact you and\nget feedback before release.

	"mdn-data": "CC0 1.0 Universal\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and\nsubsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the\npurpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific\nworks (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear of later\nclaims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse\nand redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any\npurposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\n  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or\n  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\n  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation\n  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer\n  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions\n  or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\n  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n  CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\n<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>",

	"metro-react-native-babel-preset": "# metro-react-native-babel-preset\n\nBabel presets for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) applications. React Native itself uses this Babel preset by default when transforming your app's source code.\n\nIf you wish to use a custom Babel configuration by writing a `babel.config.js` file in your project's root directory, you must specify all the plugins necessary to transform your code. React Native does not apply its default Babel configuration in this case. So, to make your life easier, you can use this preset to get the default configuration and then specify more plugins that run before it.\n\n## Usage\n\nAs mentioned above, you only need to use this preset if you are writing a custom `babel.config.js` file.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall `metro-react-native-babel-preset` in your app:\n\nwith `npm`:\n\n```sh\nnpm i metro-react-native-babel-preset --save-dev\n```\n\nor with `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add -d metro-react-native-babel-preset\n```\n\n### Configuring Babel\n\nThen, create a file called `babel.config.js` in your project's root directory. The existence of this `babel.config.js` file will tell React Native to use your custom Babel configuration instead of its own. Then load this preset:\n\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"module:metro-react-native-babel-preset\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can further customize your Babel configuration by specifying plugins and other options. See [Babel's `babel.config.js` documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files/) to learn more.\n\n## Help and Support\n\nIf you get stuck configuring Babel, please ask a question on Stack Overflow or find a consultant for help. If you discover a bug, please open up an issue.",

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

	"react-devtools-core": "# `react-devtools-core`\n\nA standalone React DevTools implementation.\n\nThis is a low-level package. If you're looking for the Electron app you can run, **use `react-devtools` package instead.**\n\n## API\n\n### `react-devtools-core`\n\nThis is similar requiring the `react-devtools` package, but provides several configurable options. Unlike `react-devtools`, requiring `react-devtools-core` doesn't connect immediately but instead exports a function:\n\n```js\nconst { connectToDevTools } = require(\"react-devtools-core\");\nconnectToDevTools(config);\n```\n\nRun `connectToDevTools()` in the same context as React to set up a connection to DevTools.  \nBe sure to run this function *before* importing e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, `react-native`.\n\nThe `config` object may contain:\n* `host: string` (defaults to \"localhost\") - Websocket will connect to this host.\n* `port: number` (defaults to `8097`) - Websocket will connect to this port.\n* `useHttps: boolean` (defaults to `false`) - Websocket should use a secure protocol (wss).\n* `websocket: Websocket` - Custom websocket to use. Overrides `host` and `port` settings if provided.\n* `resolveRNStyle: (style: number) => ?Object` - Used by the React Native style plug-in.\n* `retryConnectionDelay: number` (defaults to `2000`) - Milliseconds delay to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection.\n* `isAppActive: () => boolean` - If provided, DevTools will poll this method and wait until it returns true before connecting to React.\n\n## `react-devtools-core/standalone`\n\nRenders the DevTools interface into a DOM node.\n\n```js\nrequire(\"react-devtools-core/standalone\")\n  .setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById(\"container\"))\n  .setStatusListener(status => {\n    // This callback is optional...\n  })\n  .startServer(port);\n```\n\nRenders DevTools interface into a DOM node over SSL using a custom host name (Default is localhost).\n\n```js\nconst host = 'dev.server.com';\nconst options = {\n  key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),\n  cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')\n};\n\n\nrequire(\"react-devtools-core/standalone\")\n  .setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById(\"container\"))\n  .setStatusListener(status => {\n    // This callback is optional...\n  })\n  .startServer(port, host, options);\n```\n\nReference the `react-devtools` package for a complete integration example.\n\n## Development\n\nWatch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:backend\n```\n\nWatch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:standalone\n```",

	"rx-lite-aggregates": "# RxJS Aggregates Module #\n\nThe Reactive Extensions for JavaScript has a number of aggregation operators including those you might already know from the Array#extras and the upcoming ES6 standard such as `reduce`, `find` and `findIndex`.  This module is used exclusively for aggregation operations used on finite observable sequences.  In addition to the aforementioned operators, there are many useful operators such as `count`, `sum`, `average` and determining whether two sequences are equal via the `sequenceEqual` method.  This requires `rx.lite.js` from the [`rx-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rx-lite) NPM module.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThere are a number of ways to get started with RxJS.\n\n### Installing with [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)\n\n```bash`\n$ npm install rx-lite-aggregates\n$ npm install -g rx-lite-aggregates\n```\n\n### Using with Node.js and Ringo.js\n\n```js\nvar Rx = require('rx-lite-aggregates');\n```\n\n### In a Browser:\n\n```html\n<!-- Just the core RxJS -->\n<script src=\"path/to/rx.lite.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"path/to/rx.lite.aggregates.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## Included Observable Operators ##\n\n### `Observable Instance Methods`\n- [`aggregate`](../../doc/api/core/operators/reduce.md)\n- [`all`](../../doc/api/core/operators/every.md)\n- [`any`](../../doc/api/core/operators/some.md)\n- [`average`](../../doc/api/core/operators/average.md)\n- [`includes`](../../doc/api/core/operators/includes.md)\n- [`count`](../../doc/api/core/operators/count.md)\n- [`elementAt`](../../doc/api/core/operators/elementat.md)\n- [`elementAtOrDefault`](../../doc/api/core/operators/elementatordefault.md)\n- [`every`](../../doc/api/core/operators/every.md)\n- [`find`](../../doc/api/core/operators/find.md)\n- [`findIndex`](../../doc/api/core/operators/findindex.md)\n- [`first`](../../doc/api/core/operators/first.md)\n- [`firstOrDefault`](../../doc/api/core/operators/firstordefault.md)\n- [`indexOf`](../../doc/api/core/operators/indexof.md)\n- [`isEmpty`](../../doc/api/core/operators/isempty.md)\n- [`last`](../../doc/api/core/operators/last.md)\n- [`lastOrDefault`](../../doc/api/core/operators/lastordefault.md)\n- [`max`](../../doc/api/core/operators/max.md)\n- [`maxBy`](../../doc/api/core/operators/maxby.md)\n- [`min`](../../doc/api/core/operators/min.md)\n- [`minBy`](../../doc/api/core/operators/minby.md)\n- [`reduce`](../../doc/api/core/operators/reduce.md)\n- [`sequenceEqual`](../../doc/api/core/operators/sequenceequal.md)\n- [`single`](../../doc/api/core/operators/single.md)\n- [`singleOrDefault`](../../doc/api/core/operators/singleordefault.md)\n- [`some`](../../doc/api/core/operators/some.md)\n- [`sum`](../../doc/api/core/operators/sum.md)\n- [`toMap`](../../doc/api/core/operators/tomap.md)\n- [`toSet`](../../doc/api/core/operators/toset.md)\n\n## Contributing ##\n\nThere are lots of ways to contribute to the project, and we appreciate our [contributors](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/wiki/Contributors).

	"sane": "[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane)\n\nsane\n----\n\nI've been driven to insanity by node filesystem watcher wrappers.\nSane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher. It does that by:\n\n* By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive\n* Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues\n* Maintains a consistent API across different platforms\n* Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:\n  * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)\n  * [the watchexec library](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)\n  * polling\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install sane\n```\n\n## How to choose a mode\n\nDon't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane\nmaintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.\n\n* If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode\n* If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode\n* If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman`\n* If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling\n* Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you\n\n## API\n\n### sane(dir, options)\n\nWatches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.\n\n```js\nvar watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']});\nwatcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') });\nwatcher.on('change', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file changed', filepath); });\nwatcher.on('add', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file added', filepath); });\nwatcher.on('delete', function (filepath, root) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); });\n// close\nwatcher.close();\n```\n\noptions:\n\n* `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them.\n* `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`.\n* `watchman`: makes the watcher use [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/).\n* `watchmanPath`: sets a custom path for `watchman` binary.\n* `watchexec`: makes the watcher use [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec).\n* `dot`: enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.\n* `ignored`: a glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.\n\nFor the glob pattern documentation, see [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).\nIf you choose to use `watchman` you'll have to [install watchman yourself](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)).\nIf you choose to use `watchexec` you'll have to [install watchexec yourself](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)).\nFor the ignored options, see [anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch).\n\n### sane.NodeWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe default watcher class. Uses `fs.watch` under the hood, and takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.WatchmanWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe watchman watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.Watchexec(dir, options)\n\nThe watchexec watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.PollWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe polling watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)` with the addition of:\n\n* interval: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to fs.watchFile)\n\n### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher#close\n\nStops watching.\n\n### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher events\n\nEmits the following events:\n\nAll events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory\n* `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory\n* `change` when a file changes\n* `add` when a file or directory has been added\n* `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted\n\n## CLI\n\nThis module includes a simple command line interface, which you can install with `npm install sane -g`.\n\n```\nUsage: sane <command> [...directory] [--glob=<filePattern>] [--poll] [--watchman] [--watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>] [--dot] [--wait=<seconds>]\n\nOPTIONS:\n    --glob=<filePattern>\n      A single string glob pattern or an array of them.\n\n    --ignored=<filePattern>\n      A glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.\n\n    --poll, -p\n      Use polling mode.\n\n    --watchman, -w\n      Use watchman (if available).\n\n    --watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>\n      Sets a custom path for watchman binary (if using this mode).\n\n    --dot, -d\n      Enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.\n\n    --wait=<seconds>\n      Duration, in seconds, that watching will be disabled\n      after running <command>. Setting this option will\n      throttle calls to <command> for the specified duration.\n    --quiet, -q\n      Disables sane's console output\n\n    --changes-only, -o\n      Runs <command> only when a change occur. Skips running <command> at startup\n```\n\nIt will watch the given `directory` and run the given <command> every time a file changes.\n\n### CLI example usage\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --glob='**/*.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' site/assets/css --glob='**/*.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --glob='**/*.css' --ignored='**/ignore.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --wait=3`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' -p`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Credits\nThe CLI was originally based on the [watch CLI](https://github.com/mikeal/watch).

	"stream-buffers": "# Node Stream Buffers\r\n\r\n[![Build Status][badge-travis-img]][badge-travis-url]\r\n[![Code Climate][badge-climate-img]][badge-climate-url]\r\n[![Code Coverage][badge-coverage-img]][badge-coverage-url]\r\n\r\nSimple Readable and Writable Streams that use a [Buffer][node-buffer-docs] to store received data, or for data to send out. Useful for test code, debugging, and a wide range of other utilities.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n[![NPM][badge-npm-img]][badge-npm-url]\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use the stream buffers in your module, simply import it and away you go.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar streamBuffers = require(\"stream-buffers\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Writable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nWritable Stream Buffers implement the standardized writable stream interface. All write()'s to this object will accumulate in an internal Buffer. If the Buffer overflows it will be resized larger automatically. The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tinitialSize: (100 * 1024),\t\t// start as 100 kilobytes.\r\n\tincrementAmount: (10 * 1024)\t// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE \t\t// (8 * 1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT\t// (8 * 1024)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWriting is standard Stream stuff:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer);\r\n// - or -\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nstreamBuffers.size();\t\t\t// 4.\r\nstreamBuffers.maxSize();\t\t// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024).\r\n```\r\n\r\nRetrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t\t\t\t// Gets all held data as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\");\t\t// Gets all held data as a utf8 string.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);\t\t\t\t\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\", 5);\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCare should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).\r\n \r\nDestroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();\r\n\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t// Returns ASDF in Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"Yeah?\");\t\t// No effect.\r\n```\t\r\n\r\n### Readable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nReadable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out. \r\n\r\nThe frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tfrequency: 10,\t\t// in milliseconds.\r\n\tchunkSize: 2048\t\t// in bytes.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefault frequency and chunk size:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE \t\t// (1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY\t\t\t// (1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPutting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer);\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\t// Yup.\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing. \r\n\r\nsetEncoding() for streams is respected too:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding(\"utf8\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof String);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again. \r\n\r\nDestroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon();\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String!\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.size();\t\t\t// will be 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nNot supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
